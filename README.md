# fishingvizr
This R package can be used to request spatiotemporal fishing effort information from the Global Fishing Watch API (https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/) and generate map plots for data visualization.

### Introduction
#### Global Fishing Watch (https://globalfishingwatch.org/about-us/) is an online platform that uses satellite technology to monitor and track fishing activities across the world’s oceans in real-time. It was founded in 2015 as a partnership between Google, Oceana, and SkyTruth, with the aim of increasing transparency and accountability in the fishing industry. One of the key features of Global Fishing Watch is its Application Programming Interface (API), providing a wealth of information, including vessel positions and movements and fishing activity. This R package was developed to ease the process of requesting fishing effort data from the API and generating map plots for data visualization. The requested data are formatted as a data frame, and map plots can be printed to jpg files for users’ applications.
